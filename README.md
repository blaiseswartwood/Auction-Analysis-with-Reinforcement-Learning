# Auction-Analysis-with-Reinforcement-Learning
Analysis of Ideal Auctions using Reinforcement Learning

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment
2. Dependencies:
   
```bash
pip install numpy torch pandas tqdmp
```

## Usage

Note: Achieving convergence can be difficult and it is easy to get stuck in local optimum. Best results will take several trials to obtain.

## Results

### Discrete (Dynamic Programming)

1. Second-price auction simplest case (two agents, one item):
