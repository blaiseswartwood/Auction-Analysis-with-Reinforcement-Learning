# Auction-Analysis-with-Reinforcement-Learning
Analysis of Ideal Auctions using Reinforcement Learning

## Setup:
1. Create a virtual environment
2. Dependencies:
   
```bash
pip install numpy torch pandas tqdmp
```

Note: Achieving convergence can be difficult and it is easy to get stuck in local optimum. Best results will take several trials to obtain.

## Discrete (Dynamic Programming) results:

1. Second-price auction simplest case (two agents, one item):
